DrawingBoard
============
Assignment three & four of Advanced Java: Standard Edition with Abbas Moghtanei. 
This program is a drawing board and should allow the user to draw using a character brush with different colors as well
as erase, clear the screen, save and load a file, plus create different shapes. The current version is workable, but 
I plan on making it more user intuitive and fixing some bugs soon!
